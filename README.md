# Learning git :)

I enrolled in course by Amigoscode - https://amigoscode.com/courses/1317178 <br />
Great course, very easy to follow and it works if you <br />
  *do not have any knowledge of git at all <br />
  *have used git a few times, but want to understand the most important things better <br />
